An exploratory project that:
- Fetch and store current weather data from openweathermap.org (https://openweathermap.org/current).
- Expose those data with an API.
- Runs a (dummy) ML pipeline to predict the total wind energy generated during the last hour in France (using the wind from the weather data). Predictions are also exposed in the API.
